# PathFindingVisualizer
A visualization of the AStar path finding algorithm. 

visualization consists of a grid of squares where one is the start position square, one is the end position. all squares are initially valid positions to travel across where the algorithm is concerned, but can be made into obstacles with a mouse press.

upon starting the algorithm, the sequence of steps towards discovering the shortest path from start to end is visualized by color changes in the squares representing explored and next-to-explore states.
